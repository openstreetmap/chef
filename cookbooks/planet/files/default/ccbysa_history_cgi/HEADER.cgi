<p>The <tt>full-planet-120401-final.osm.bz2</tt> file is the last dump of data before <a href="https://blog.osmfoundation.org/2012/07/26/automated-redactions-complete/">redactions were run to remove data which could not be released under ODbL</a>. The <tt>full-planet-120601-1150.osm.bz2</tt> is the last dump of data available under CC BY-SA, but after the redactions were run. This means it may have less data in some areas, although many redactions were quickly re-mapped.</p>
