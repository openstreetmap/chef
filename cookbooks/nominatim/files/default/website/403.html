<h1>Access blocked</h1>

<p>You have been blocked because you have violated the
<a href="https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/">usage policy</a>
of OSM's Nominatim geocoding service. Please be aware that OSM's resources are
limited and shared between many users. The usage policy is there to ensure that
the service remains usable for everybody.</p>

<p>Please review the terms and make sure that your
software adheres to the terms. You should in particular verify that you have set a
<b>custom HTTP referrer or HTTP user agent</b> that identifies your application, and
that you are not overusing the service with massive bulk requests.
If you do that then the block usually goes away after some hours of inactivity.</p>

<p>Please be aware that we are providing this service as-is and without any
guarantees. We cannot provide support. If you need that, please have a look
at comercial alternatives (also listed on the usage policy page) or set up
your own instance of Nominatim.</p>
