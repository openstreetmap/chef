<h1>Access blocked</h1>

<p>You have been blocked because you have violated the
<a href="https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/nominatim/">usage policy</a>
of OSM's Nominatim geocoding service. Please be aware that OSM's resources are
limited and shared between many users. The usage policy is there to ensure that
the service remains usable for everybody.</p>

<p>Please review the terms and make sure that your
software adheres to the terms. You should in particular verify that you have set a
<b>custom HTTP referrer or HTTP user agent</b> that identifies your application, and
that you are not overusing the service with massive bulk requests.</p>

<p>If you feel that this block is unjustified or remains after you have adopted
your usage, you may contact the Nominatim system administrator at
nominatim@openstreetmap.org to have this block lifted.</p>
